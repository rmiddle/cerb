<H3>Default Sender</H3>

When a worker replies to messages from Cerb, this email address will be 
used as the sender by default.  This proxy protects your workers' direct email 
addresses and ensures that all replies are routed back to Cerb.  Each 
group may configure their own sender information (e.g., sales@yourcompany, 
support@yourcompany, marketing@yourcompany).<br>
<br>
The sender <b>absolutely must</b> be an email address that routes back into 
Cerb (e.g. by POP3) so that incoming replies to your messages are properly 
received.<br>
<br>

<b>What email address should be the default sender for outgoing email?</b><br>
<input type="text" name="default_reply_from" value="{$default_reply_from}" placeholder="support@example.com" size="64">
(e.g. support@example.com)

<b>Would you like to use a personalized sender name for outgoing email?</b> (optional)<br>
<input type="text" name="default_reply_personal" value="{$default_reply_personal}" placeholder="Example, Inc." size="64">
(e.g. "Acme Widgets Helpdesk")
