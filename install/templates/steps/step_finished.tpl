<H3>Welcome to the community!</H3>

Cerb6 is the culmination of over 10 years of R&amp;D.  As with any innovation, there may be some 
concepts introduced that are completely new to you and your team.<br>
<br>
The best places to become familiar with Cerb concepts are the <a href="https://vimeo.com/channels/cerb" target="_blank">training videos</a> and the <a href="http://www.cerberusweb.com/book/" target="_blank">online documentation</a>.<br>
