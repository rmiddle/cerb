<h3>You are now running in Evaluation mode</h3>

<div style="margin-left:20px;">
	Each new Cerb installation defaults to Evaluation mode,
	which provides full functionality for this version with no expiration. Without a license you are currently limited to one 
	simultaneous worker (a "seat").<br>
	<br>
	
	<b>If you answer a few questions below to introduce yourself, we'll send you a free license for 3 seats to help you get started.  
	Your license will never expire for <u>this version</u> of the software.</b><br>
	<br>
	
	We hope that you find the software useful, and we're looking forward to growing along with you.<br>
	<br>
	
	For organizations that require more than 3 seats, <a href="https://cerb.ai/pricing/" target="_blank">we offer affordable and flexible licensing
	options</a>.<br>
