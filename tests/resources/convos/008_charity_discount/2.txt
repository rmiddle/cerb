> Do you provide any discounts for non-profits?

Hi Lisa,

Yes!  We provide free licenses to charitable organizations and established open source projects.

We use the U.S. Internal Revenue Service definition of charitable organizations from Section 501(c)(3):
http://www.irs.gov/Charities-&amp;-Non-Profits/Charitable-Organizations/Exemption-Requirements-Section-501(c)(3)-Organizations

Let us know the organization name and how many seats you need, and we'll send over a license.
