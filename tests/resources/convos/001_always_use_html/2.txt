Hi Alessio,

Each worker can configure that preference with these instructions:

1. Click your name in the top right
2. Select 'settings'
3. Under 'While replying:' check the box for 'Always switch to HTML mode'
4. Save changes

We don't have a global preference for this yet where admins can set the default for everyone. I'll check with the developers to see if that's something we can do in the next update.

#comment @Milo How difficult would it be to create a global preference for HTML mode on replies? Fiaflux wants workers to reply in HTML by default without each worker having to configure the preference.
