Hi Mathias,

Currently we recommend that alternate languages are different knowledgebase topics, but we realize that this is not ideal for many reasons.

There's an open feature request to allow alternate translations on each article:
https://wgmdev.atlassian.net/browse/CHD-3721

I've linked your interest to it, and you'll receive a notification with any progress.

Thanks for the report!
