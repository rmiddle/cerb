> is Cerb ITIL compliant?

Hi Zhang,

Since Cerb is a toolkit for building and automating your own workflows, it's not intended to be ITIL compliant out of the box.

However, you can use Cerb's tools (workspaces, dashboards, Virtual Attendants) to build ITIL compatible processes. Over time, we'll likely provide pre-built bundles like this to make implementation easier.

What aspects of ITIL are most important to you to start with? We'd be happy to help point you in the right direction.
