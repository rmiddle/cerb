Hi ZÃ¶e,

Make sure your scheduler jobs are running.  You can find them in Setup->Configure->Scheduler.

You can click the "run now" link for 'Mailbox (POP3/IMAP) Checker and Email Downloader' and 'Inbound Email Message Processor' to run them manually.

If that works, you need to set up a cronjob on your server to ping the /cron URL on your site every minute or so using wget or curl.
