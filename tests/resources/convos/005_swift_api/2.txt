> Is there a Cerb API library for Swift?

Hi Kayla!

We don't have an official Swift library for the Cerb API yet, but it should be pretty easy to port one of the existing ones to use NSURL instead.

You can refer to the existing libraries here:
http://cerbweb.com/book/latest/developer_guide/rest_api/index.html#libraries

If you need any help with that process, let us know.

If you decide to release your Swift library under an open source community, I'd be happy to share the link with the community.
