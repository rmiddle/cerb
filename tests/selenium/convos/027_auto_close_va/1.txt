Subject: Automatically closing waiting tickets after some time
Message-Id: <convo27.msg1@cerb.example>

Our agents currently set tickets to the 'waiting' status after replying. Many of these tickets never receive another client reply.

How can we automatically close tickets that are waiting and do not receive a client reply after some duration (e.g. 7 days)?

Can we send a warning a few days before the tickets are automatically closed?
