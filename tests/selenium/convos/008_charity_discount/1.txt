Subject: Not-for-profit licensing?
Message-Id: <convo8.msg1@cerb.example>

We use the Cerb system at Donter Institute and we're very happy with it. We work with several non-profit entities that would benefit from the software, but they have relatively small budgets for licensing.

Do you provide any discounts for non-profits?
