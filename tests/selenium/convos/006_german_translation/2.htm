	<td>&gt; Out of interest, do you have a German language version of Cerb?

Hi Teun,

Yeah, German is our second most complete translation.&nbsp;&nbsp;Out of about 1,080 fragments of text, only 300 need to be updated in German, and that can be done from the browser with our built-in Translation Editor plugin.&nbsp;&nbsp;The translation coverage is better than 75% because the most common phrases (e.g. new, close, from/to, status, etc) are repeated pretty often.

The 6.9 release also includes some subtle changes to make translations easier using external TMX editors.&nbsp;&nbsp;Heartsome is a pretty efficient one: http://translation-blog.com/heartsome-tm-editor/

We also offer a $0.50 credit toward On-Site or On-Demand subscriptions per translation entry.&nbsp;&nbsp;So if you had someone translate those last 300 entries (mostly for new additions to the Plugin Library that were created after the original translations), then you'd get a $150 credit.

Let me know if there's anything I can do to help with that.
